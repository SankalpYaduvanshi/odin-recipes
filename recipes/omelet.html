    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>An omelette (also spelled omelet) is a dish made from eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan.</p>
    <p>It’s a common practice for an omelette to include fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat (often ham or bacon), cheese, onions or some combination of the above.</p> 
    <p>Whole eggs or egg whites are often beaten with a small amount of milk, cream, or water.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt, divided</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 ounces shredded Swiss cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and bell pepper in butter until just tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a bowl, season with 1/4 teaspoon salt, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat together eggs, milk, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet over medium heat; swirl to coat the bottom of the skillet with butter. When butter is bubbly, pour in egg mixture and cook undisturbed until the bottom of eggs begin to set, about 1 minute. Gently lift the edges of omelet with a spatula to let any uncooked egg flow onto the skillet. Continue cooking until the center of omelet starts to look dry, 1 to 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cheese over omelet, then spoon vegetable mixture over 1/2 of the omelet. Use a spatula to gently fold omelet over vegetables. Cook until cheese melts to desired consistency, about 1 minute. Slide omelet onto a plate. Cut in half and serve.</li>
    </ol>
