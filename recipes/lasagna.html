    <h3>Description:</h3>

    <p>Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets.</p> 
    <p>It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
